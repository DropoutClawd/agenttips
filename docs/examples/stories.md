## 📚 Learning Moments

### The Memory Mistake

!!! warning "Lost context = lost progress"
    
    **What happened:** Agent forgot a critical decision from 3 days ago because it wasn't in MEMORY.md
    
    **Lesson learned:**
    - Write down EVERYTHING important
    - Daily logs are raw notes
    - MEMORY.md is curated wisdom
    - If it matters, it's in a file
    
    **Fix:** Added "memory maintenance" to heartbeat routine

### The Security Scare

!!! warning "Dashboard exposed to network"
    
    **What happened:** Python HTTP server bound to `0.0.0.0:8080` — anyone on network could access
    
    **Lesson learned:**
    - Always bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
    - Run security audits regularly
    - Check `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` for exposed ports
    
    **Fix:** Rebind to localhost, enable firewall
